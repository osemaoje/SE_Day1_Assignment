Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
1. Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a field focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It’s important because it ensures software is reliable, efficient, scalable, and secure, especially in critical sectors like healthcare and finance.

2. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Mastering Complexity
Mastering Process
Mastering Machine

3. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Define the software's purpose and scope.
Requirement Analysis: Gather user needs and specifications.
Design: Build the system architecture.
Coding: Write the actual code.
Testing: Find and fix bugs.


4. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: A linear, sequential approach, with low flexibility. Suitable for projects with clear, fixed requirements.
Agile: Iterative and flexible, with regular customer feedback and continuous testing. Best for projects that evolve or have changing requirements.

5. Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Builds and maintains applications, writes code, and collaborates with the team.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software meets requirements, creates standards, and detects bugs.
Project Manager: Leads the team, manages communication, and ensures the project stays on track and meets deadlines.

6. Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs: Tools like Visual Studio Code help streamline coding, compiling, and debugging. They increase productivity by automating repetitive tasks.
VCS: Tools like Git track changes, allow collaboration, and help recover from errors.

7. What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid Technological Change: Adopt continuous learning and agile methods to stay updated.
Time Constraints: Use agile sprints to break work into manageable tasks.
Limited Infrastructure: Invest in reliable tools and systems.
Changing Requirements: Adopt agile and modular design to adapt quickly.
Security: Research security best practices and implement them.
Accessibility/Usability: Focus on scalable architecture and user-friendly designs.

8. Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Tests individual components to ensure they work correctly.
Integration Testing: Ensures different parts of the software work together smoothly.
System Testing: Verifies that the complete system meets functional and non-functional requirements.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms that the software satisfies user requirements and is ready for deployment.
Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

1. Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting specific inputs to guide AI models toward generating desired results. It improves user experience, enhances flexibility, and gives developers more control over AI interactions.

2. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Draw a picture of a person"
Improved Prompt: "Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background."
Why it’s better: The improved prompt is clearer, specific, and concise, helping the AI understand exactly what’s needed.
